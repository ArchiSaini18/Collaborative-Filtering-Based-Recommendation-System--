🎬 **Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering**

This project builds a collaborative filtering–based movie recommendation engine using user–item interactions (ratings). By analyzing patterns of how users rate movies, 
the system identifies hidden preferences and recommends movies based on the similarity of user behaviors. The goal is to help users discover movies that align with the tastes 
of similar users.

📌 Project Overview

In this project, we:

• Load and preprocess a movie ratings dataset (movieId, title, userId, rating).
• Use collaborative filtering techniques to learn user–movie interaction patterns.
• Apply user-based and item-based similarity approaches to recommend unseen movies.
• Build a recommendation pipeline that suggests top N movies for a given user.
• Evaluate recommendations quantitatively using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and qualitatively by testing relevance.

📂 Dataset

• Source: Kaggle.
• Typical Features: movieId, title, userId, rating.
• Target: Unsupervised (recommendations based on rating similarity).

🛠️ Technologies Used

• Python 3.x
• Pandas, NumPy – data handling
• Scikit-learn – similarity metrics, evaluation
• Surprise / implicit / LightFM – collaborative filtering models
• Matplotlib / Seaborn – visualization

📊 Model Selection & Evaluation

• Memory-based methods: User–User and Item–Item Collaborative Filtering (cosine similarity, Pearson correlation).
• Model-based methods: Matrix Factorization (SVD, NMF) to learn latent features.
• Evaluation via RMSE, MAE on held-out ratings.
• Human interpretability: recommendations must match user preferences.

📈 Visualizations

• Distribution of user ratings.
• Heatmap of user–item rating matrix (sparsity patterns).
• Similarity scores between users and between items.
• Recommendation examples: input user vs. top 5 suggested movies.

🧭 Workflow

Movie Ratings Data → Preprocessing (filtering, normalization) → User–Item Matrix → Collaborative Filtering (User/User or Item/Item, Matrix Factorization) →
Recommendation Pipeline → Visualization & Evaluation

💼 Deliverables

• Cleaned user–movie rating dataset
• Trained collaborative filtering model (User–User, Item–Item, or Matrix Factorization)
• Recommendation function (get_recommendations(userId))
• Report showcasing recommendations for selected users

🔮 Future Improvements

• Hybrid model: combine collaborative filtering with content-based methods.
• Incorporate implicit feedback (e.g., clicks, watch history).
• Deploy an interactive Streamlit/Gradio app for real-time movie recommendations.
• Online learning to adapt as new ratings are added.
